# Virtual Classroom Manager  

The **Virtual Classroom Manager** is a simple **console-based Java application** that simulates a digital classroom environment. It is designed to demonstrate **OOP principles**, **design patterns**, and **best coding practices** in a clean and structured way.  

This project allows administrators and students to interact with a classroom system where:  
-  Classrooms can be created and managed.  
-  Students can enroll in specific classrooms.  
-  Assignments can be scheduled for each classroom.  
-  Students can submit assignments.  
-  Teachers/Managers can view assignment submissions per classroom.  
-  Classrooms and enrolled students can be listed easily.

##  Features  
- Add and manage multiple **classrooms**.  
- Enroll **students** in specific classrooms.  
- Create and assign **assignments** to classrooms.  
- Submit assignments by student ID.  
- View submissions for a particular assignment in a classroom.  
- List available classrooms and enrolled students.

##  Key Highlights  
- Built with **Java (console application)** â€“ no fancy UI, just clean logic.  
- Implements **Factory Pattern** for entity creation (`Student`, `Assignment`).  
- Uses **Interface-driven design** (`IClassroomManager`) for flexibility and scalability.  
- Follows **SOLID Principles** and clean OOP design.  
- Well-structured **package organization** (`model/`, `manager/`, `factory/`, `ui/`).
